    Dear Teacher

    I know I did not split the file into functions despite your call to do so.
    This is because I, as a professional in the field, believe in this specific
    case such a split would not actually make the file more readable.

    When a script is this small keeping it all as one continues code allows the
    code to be written in the same order as it is executed. I believe that with
    the context of the assignment this code is very readable.
